<h1>Potion Panic</h1>
<i>My new WIP project where you play as a young forgetful witch who has forgetten to do all her exam preparation for her finals which start in less than 15 minutes. Complete all the tasks within the time limit to be in with a chance to pass and become a full fledged mage!</i>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For my second project, I wanted to do something on a larger scale and decided on a task-based game. I chose a task-based game as it felt very modular, making it easier to plan out the separate minigames.</p>

<p> In the future, I hope to add different difficulties to the game and also make it multiplayer if possible.</p>

<h2>Current tasks</h2>

+ Petting task - You must pet your cat familiar in the correct order based on its different features.

+ Rune task - Calculating the power level of a spell based on the runes provided.

+ Potion task - Collecting different ingredients and mixing them together to create the right potion.
